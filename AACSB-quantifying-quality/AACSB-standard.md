# AACSB's Standards For Business Accreditation


* 2013 Business Accreditation Standards &ndash; [www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/standards/2013-business](http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/standards/2013-business)

> A collegiate business school offering degrees in business administration or accounting may volunteer for an AACSB Accreditation review. As a first step, the business school must establish its eligibility for accreditation. During the initial accreditation process, the school is evaluated on how well it achieves AACSB’s accreditation standards, through a process of self-evaluation and peer review. After earning AACSB accreditation, the business school undergoes periodic peer reviews of its strategic improvement to continue its accreditation.


## Standard 5 – Faculty Sufficiency And Deployment

### Definitions

* A *participating faculty member* actively and deeply engages in the activities of the school in matters beyond direct teaching responsibilities. 
* A *supporting faculty member* does not, as a rule, participate in the intellectual or operational life of the school beyond the direct performance of teaching responsibilities.

### Guidance for Documentation

* Table 15-1 should be completed to document the deployment of participating and supporting faculty

## Standard 15 – Faculty Qualifications and Engagement

### Definitions

* *Academic engagement* reflects faculty scholarly development activities 
* *Professional engagement* reflects faculty practice-oriented development activities 
* *Scholarly Academics* (SA) 
  * Normally, SA status is granted to newly hired faculty members who earned their research doctorates within the last five years
  * There must be ongoing, sustained, and substantive academic engagement activities supporting SA and PA status.
* *Practice Academics* (PA)
  * Normally, PA status applies to faculty members who augment their initial preparation as academic scholars with development and engagement activities that involve substantive linkages to practice, consulting, other forms of professional engagement, etc.
  * There must be ongoing, sustained, and substantive academic and professional engagement 
* *Scholarly Practitioners* (SP)
  * Normally, SP status applies to *practitioner faculty* members who augment their experience with development and engagement activities involving substantive scholarly activities in their fields of teaching
  * Normally, SP faculty members also have master’s degrees in disciplines related to their fields of teaching
* *Instructional Practitioners* (IP) 
  * Normally, IP status is granted tofaculty members with significant and substantive professional experience
  * Normally, IP faculty members also have master’s degrees in disciplines related to their fields of teaching

### Guidance for Documentation

* Table 15-1: Faculty Sufficiency and Qualifications Summary (RE: Standards 5 and 15)
  * Faculty Sufficiency
    * P = Participating Faculty Productivity
    * S = Supporting Faculty Productivity
      * <small>The measure of “teaching productivity” must reflect the operations of the business school, e.g., student credit hours (SCHs), European Credit Transfer Units (ECTUs), contact hours, individual courses, modules, or other designations that are appropriately indicative of the teaching contributions of each faculty member. Concurrence of the metric must be reached with the peer review team early in the review process. [WTF?]</small>
    * Faculty Sufficiency Indicators:
      * Overall: P/(P+S) > 75%
      * By discipline, location, delivery mode, or program: P/(P+S) > 60%
  * Faculty Qualifications
    * Percent of Time Devoted to Mission for Each Faculty Qualification Group (SA, PA, SP, IP)
      * <small>The “percent of time devoted to mission” reflects each faculty member’s contributions to the school’s overall mission during the period of evaluation. Reasons for less than 100 percent might include part-time employment, shared appointment with another academic unit, or other assignments that make the faculty member partially unavailable to the school. A full-time faculty member’s percent of time devoted to mission is 100 percent.</small> 
  * Faculty Qualifications Indicators:
    * Minimum SA: (SA)/(SA +PA + SP + IP +O) > 40%
    * Minimum SA + PA + SP: (SA + PA + SP)/(SA + PA + SP + IP + O) >60%
    * Minimum SA + PA + SP + IP: (SA + PA + SP + IP)/(SA + PA + SP + IP + O) >90%
