### “Tracking Faculty Contributions”

Michael S. Wilkins. 2016. “Tracking Faculty Contributions.” *BizEd* 2016 (September/October). http://www.bizedmagazine.com/archives/2016/5/ideas-in-action/tracking-faculty-contributions.


> At the School of Business at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, we have developed our own Tracking Record that guides faculty as they describe the contributions they have made on all the key measures of the new standards. First implemented in the summer of 2014, the eight-section document also enables us to track faculty activities that go far beyond engagement, innovation, and impact.

> …

> Section 2: Student Academic and Professional Engagement. This section relates to Standard 13 and asks faculty to provide specific examples of what they’ve done to facilitate engagement. These examples might include bringing in guest lecturers, getting involved in student internship programs, sponsoring student consulting projects, participating in students’ study abroad experiences, interacting with the companies that employ our graduates, and engaging with campus organizations in professional settings.

> …

> Section 6: Impact–Practice. In this section, we ask faculty to show how their activities have had an impact on real-world business. Their supporting evidence can include information about media citations, expert witness experiences, consulting projects, articles written for practitioner publications, case studies that have led to business solutions, service on policy or practitioner boards, and research projects undertaken in collaboration with companies.

> While many universities use systems such as Sedona or Digital Measures to gather accreditation information, we feel that our approach collects a broader range of data and could be useful even for schools that rely on other systems. The Tracking Record could help administrators create custom reports that show how their schools are faring in terms of the critical measures of engagement, innovation, and impact.


* Sedona – [sedonaweb.com](https://sedonaweb.com/i/index.cfm) 

>> SEDONA is a self-service web database program that allows faculty (or staff) to use the Internet to maintain their teaching, research, and service records. Once the database is fully populated with faculty records, administrators may use it to document accreditation information, facilitate pay-for-performance programs, and manage post-tenure reviews.

* DigitalMeasures – [www.digitalmeasures.com](http://www.digitalmeasures.com)

>> *Activity Insight* makes it easy to capture essential faculty activity data in a granular and flexible fashion, ensuring your information can be used unlimited times to fulfill all of your reporting needs.

>> Simplify inefficient processes and empower your administrators to make better decisions with all the information they need right at their fingertips.

> Unfortunately, a rise in the number of adjuncts corresponds to a rise in negative outcomes, according to her research. …

> The good news is that these problems are not nearly as pervasive in business schools, she says, where accreditation standards offer clear guidance on how adjuncts should be used. It’s also common for business schools to seek out adjuncts who are practitioners with real-world experience. “That’s not always the reasoning for other departments, who are often just looking for a cheap form of labor,” she notes.
