> This Special Issue of Business & Society seeks to expand and enrich the body of research on CSR and communication (for a most recent overview, see Crane & Glozer, forthcoming). 

  Crane, Andrew, and Sarah Glozer. 2016. “Researching CSR Communication: Themes, Opportunities and Challenges.” *SSRN Scholarly Paper ID 2726879*. Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network. [https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2726879](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2726879).

> Specifically, it aims to examine the role of talk and text (including verbal, visual and written communication) in shaping the nature and meaning of CSR – and how CSR meanings in turn shape such communication. 

> This may include scholarly contributions that will extend our understanding of how rhetoric, narrative, discourse, sensemaking, and other frameworks of meaning are involved in CSR communication.

Sensemaking as a model for firm values formation and transformation?

> However, the prospective, anticipatory, and formative role of communication for CSR has, thus far, tended to remain implicit or under-theorized. 

> More specifically, communicative practices can play an important and formative role, for instance, 

>  * in constituting networked relationships between business firms and larger society (…), 

>  * in driving organizational and social change (…), 

>  * in constituting new subject relations in the field of CSR (…), and 

>  * enabling sensemaking about what CSR can and cannot be (…).

> …In other words, there is a need to understand better what communication *does* to CSR and what CSR *does* to communication.

Can communication practices limit CSR, perhaps driving it to be green-washing?  Do some forms of communication promote ethical behavior more than others?  De-personalized communication, that presents itself as the “voice of the firm”, might decrease ethical commitment&mdash;people know there is a person behind the communication, so do they perceive an avoidance of responsibility by invoking an institutional voice?

Can CSR lead to a change in the nature of all of a firm's communication? If CSR affects the sensemaking-loop for corporate values, it would presumably impact everything.

**How do organizational values affect organizational communication?**

Does CSR inherently require external communication?  If it doesn't, what does that mean to the stragetic understanding of CSR? 

> We welcome a broad range of questions and topic areas within the broad theme – some indicative questions include:

>  * What narrative structures and components are used to give meaning to the process of CSR design and implementation?

>  * How do actors in organizational settings differ in their sensemaking of CSR, including productive forms of misunderstanding?

>  * In what ways does intensified “CSR talk” influence the formation and change of individual, professional and organizational identities in the workplace (e.g., in terms of improved self-enhancement and identification as well as cynicism and “CSR fatigue”)?
