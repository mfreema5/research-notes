> The CCO perspective puts forth the idea that organizations can be seen first and foremost as phenomena of communication; that is, that organizations arise in and through language use. This theoretical perspective has been gaining ground in journals of organization and communication studies over the past decade. The CCO perspective addresses the ontological question “what is an organization?” – one of the most fundamental issues in organization studies. In response to this question, proponents of the CCO perspective argue that organizations essentially consist of communication. By **conceptualizing organizations as interlocking networks of unfolding communication processes**, the CCO perspective turns the common understanding of organization “inside out” arguing that it is through communicative practices, and not primarily through specific individual human members, that organizations are created and sustained. In other words, according to this view, **organizations do not consist of directors, managers, and other employees but result from the interactions among these members**, as well as between those and third parties.

> Organizations are sites where meaning is continuously negotiated.

My twist:  The values of organizations are continuously negotiated.

> …the constitutive view of CSR communication implies that the role of managers in charge of CSR communication should not be limited to the dissemination of information but should also involve the tasks of “sensemaking” and “translation”, which can help CSR communication practices to gain resonance within the organization.

> …important implications for business practice and for how business and society interrelate. As explained earlier, switching to the explicit CCO view implies that CSR communication can only gain traction within organizations – corporations in particular – if it **becomes connected to other core communicative practices**. In practical terms, this means that CSR communication should not be reduced to a corporate function that is fulfilled by a stand-alone (or “satellite”) department of CSR or corporate communications, but should be treated as a holistic endeavor that encompasses the organization as a whole.

My twist:  CSR can only gain traction if it is compatible with existant organizational values.  In other words, if the CSR values “become connected to other core” values, they can become part of the organization.

> Finally, the CCO perspective allows the integration of the field of CSR communication research into a broader theory of society (Luhmann, 1995) by **grounding it in the epistemology of the communicative constitution of social reality** (Cooren, 2012).
