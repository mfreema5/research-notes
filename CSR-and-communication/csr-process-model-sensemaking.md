## CSR – Process Model of Sensemaking

> Organizational sensemaking, as mentioned above, involves a tripartite view of its essential
processes: (1) cognitive, which implies thinking about the organization's relationships with its stakeholders and views about the broader world (i.e., the "common good" that goes beyond what's good for business), as well as the rationale for engaging in specific activities that might have an impact on key relationships; (2) linguistic, which involves ways of explaining the organization's reasons for engaging in specific activities and how it goes about sharing such explanations with others; and (3) conative, which involves the behavioral posture it adopts, ties to that of organizational sensemaking? along with the commitment and consistency it shows in conducting activities that impinge on its perceived relationships. (Basu and Palazzo, 2008)

And yet:

>Basu and Palazzo (2008) identified a process model o f sensemaking which explains how organizations define and shape their corporate social responsibility. Through a cognitive, linguistic, and conative process, organizational actors discuss their relationship with stakeholders, their roles in the society, and the behavioral dispositions for the fulfillment of these roles and relationships. ***Though these scholars do not link the tripartite process with Wieck's (1995) properties of sensemaking***, these aspects of the process contain some of those properties. (Chittuparamban, 2013)

>The *cognitive* process involves what the organizations think about identity orientation and legitimacy. Identity orientation explains the shared perceptions of beliefs, values, and norms that unite the members of the organization and these shared perceptions determine the way they make sense ofthe external environment and their relationship with varied elements of the environment (p. 125-126). Legitimacy that explains the efforts of the organizations to gain social acceptance through compliance with socially accepted norms, values, beliefs, and definitions shares certain characteristics of the social nature of sensemaking. (Chittuparamban, 2013)

>The *linguistic* dimension of the process model of sensemaking constitutes justification and transparency (Basu and Palazzo, 2008). Justification explains how organizations narrate the enactment or the actions adopted based on identity orientation. Transparency explains what the organization communicates with the society and involves a balanced or biased approached.…  (Chittuparamban, 2013)

And back to Basu and Palazzo:

>Thus, we can define CSR as ‘the process by which managers within an organization think about and discuss relationships with stakeholders as well as their roles in relation to the common good, along with their behavioral disposition with respect to the fulfillment and achievement of these roles and relationships’.
