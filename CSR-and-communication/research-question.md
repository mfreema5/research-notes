# Research Question


CSR is an expression of corporate values

Communication related to CSR not only reveals corporate values but influences them, as the communication is included in, and produced by, the ongoing organizational sensemaking process.

Discordant CSR—the sort which relies on values missing from, or at odds with, the organization's existing values—will disrupt the sensemaking cycle, as the communication is discordant with other communication.

Use existing research on “greenwashing” and the discord between apparent CSR and internal corporate practices to demonstrate the resulting disruption to sensemaking.

Complementary CSR—the sort that is complementary to the the organization's existing values—will reinforce those values, as the CSR communication harmonizes with other communication.

¿Use existing research on the strategic value of CSR for example cases?

## Values

Is there a better word than “value”?  There's going to be confusing when discussion business's and “values”.

* ***Value:*** *something (as a principle or quality) intrinsically valuable or desirable* 

I find “intrinsic” intriguing. Does intrinsic value arise from matching an intrinsic motivation? Is making a profit an *intrinsic* motivation for a firm, or an *extrinsic* one?

:Intrinsic Motivation – 16 Basic Desires (Reiss 2004)

* Reiss, Steven. 2004. “Multifaceted Nature of Intrinsic Motivation: The Theory of 16 Basic Desires.” *Review of General Psychology* 8 (3): 179–93. [doi:10.1037/1089-2680.8.3.179](http://doi.org/10.1037/1089-2680.8.3.179).

Do any of those motivations apply to an organization?  Are motivations transmitted from member to organization?  Probably not.  Maybe motivations rise from the values?  That's rather circular, though.  Motivations derive from vision?  From mission?  Member's have desires within the context of the organization—are those at all related to the organization?  Identity?  If you identify as a member of an organization, you want its values to match some vision of the organization you have.  (You don't necessarily want the organization's values to match your own, though they need to be somehow compatible, of course.)

What does an organization *desire*?  Or is that excessive anthropomorphization?

Desire is needed for intrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation is needed to explain (intrinsic) values.  Or is it?

A resource-based view of the firm would seem to imply that everything in a firm has an extrinsic value.

Must CSR have extrinsic value?  Would reinforcement of values qualify?

>That which is intrinsically good is nonderivatively good; it is good for its own sake. That which is not intrinsically good but extrinsically good is derivatively good; it is good, not (insofar as its extrinsic value is concerned) for its own sake, but for the sake of something else that is good and to which it is related in some way.

If new CSR communication is compatible with existing communication, it reinforces it.

If new CSR communication is not compatible with existing communication, it disrupts it.

When the communication is disrupted, sensemaking strives to reconcile the discordant communication.  Either the CSR shifts to fit the organization's values, or the organization's values shift to include the CSR.

**Is the nature of communication is a consequence of the values behind it?**
