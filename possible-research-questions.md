## Consensus vocabulary

### Hypothesis

Part of the process of sense-making involves developing a consensus vocabulary.  Using the same words in the same way signals agreement with a some part of a proposed meaning, and growing standardization of vocabulary signals a move toward consensus.  (Cites to back that up?)

### What

Track the vocabulary associated with hashtagged discussions over time, and see if consensus vocabularies develop.

### Why

Being able to identify a **_consensus vocabulary_** facilitates answering a number of research questions, such the impact of timeliness on sense-making, and interaction/isolation of communities of meaning, a.k.a., online echo-chambers.

## Communities of Meaning

### Hypothesis

Every person has a group of people whom they include in their sense-making process; i.e., everyone belongs to a “community of meaning”, within which sense-making about the world happens.

Some communities of meaning have largely impermeable borders.  So-called online “echo-chambers” are related to such impermeable communities of meaning.  Perhaps as causes, as effects, or simply as their online extension.

### What

Identify communities of meaning on Twitter by looking at follow-networks, involvement in hashtagged discussions, and overlap of individuals' vocabulary with the **_consensus vocabulary_** related to some event/meaning.

### Why

Once communities of meaning can be identified, researchers can study how they interact with each other, the ways they achieve isolation, the differences in how they engage in sense-making, and  how they arrive at different meanings of the same events.

## Impact of timeliness on sense-making

### Hypothesis

Meanings proposed early in a sense-making cycle are more likely to be integrated into the eventual consensus meaning, irrespective of their other merits compared to meanings proposed later.

### What 

On Twitter track over time the word counts related to hashtagged discussions.  Do early keywords that are eventually rejected take longer to drop away than later rejections?  Can the decay of a keyword be accurately predicted based on its rise; does the timing of the entrance of the keyword impact that?  How quickly is a **_consensus vocabulary_** established, and how much, if any, impact can late-comers have on it?

### Why

Organizations can control not only the impact, but the *meaning* of the message by controlling its timing.

----

## Impact of timeliness on sense-making (fan-focus)

### Hypothesis

Meanings proposed early in a sense-making cycle are more likely to be integrated into the eventual consensus meaning, irrespective of their other merits compared to meanings proposed later.

### What 

On Twitter look at live-tweets about TV shows.  Are the same users the first to propose meanings for major show events?  Identify how long it takes for consensus to be achieved by tracking diversity of vocabulary.  See if users tweeting later have any influence on the consensus by looking for shift in **_consensus vocabulary_** over time.

### Why

If influence on meaning is dependent on timing of tweets, then a user can increase her power in the community of fans by live-tweeting instead of post-tweeting.  More generally, shifts in power in a community of practice may be augured by shifts in patterns of participation.
